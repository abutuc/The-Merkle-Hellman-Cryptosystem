# The-Merkle-Hellman-Cryptosystem
This project consisted on the development and study of different algorithms to break The Merkle-Hellman Cryptosystem. As end-result I made a report which stated and compared the different algorithms used, as well as their performance when it came to the inputted dataset.
The project was developed during the course Algorithms and Data Structures where the focus was the understanding of the different types of algorithms, their time complexity and how to use them in the appropriate situation.
